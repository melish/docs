#  VeSafe


<small class="github">[VeSafe](https://github.com/EU-OSHA/VeSafe)</small>

##Pre-requisites

Note: setting up a LAMP stack is outside the scope of this project, it depends
on the operating system and is subject to each developer's decision. We are
providing a general guide to setup your project.

In order to make the project work the following assumptions are made:

  * You have a working LAMP stack on your dev machine

  * You have `drush` installed and working on your computer. To install Drush I recommend to install from source repo like this:
    
        cd /opt
    git clone https://github.com/drush-ops/drush.git
    cd drush
    git checkout 8.1.3 (if is not working properly, try 7.3.0)
    composer install (subsequent updates to Drush requires to re-run composer install.)
    

  * Add drush executable to your $PATH (i.e. `ln -s /opt/drush/drush /usr/bin`), open a console and run `drush init` to set up `~/.drush` directory as well as aliases and shortcuts

##Project setup

###  Setup database

Create a database called `osha_vesafe` in your MySQL database. You can either
use `root` with password, or setup another user and password to connect from
Drupal

###  Prepare drush

Assuming you open a console and `drush` works, edit `~/.drush/drushrc.php` and
add this snippet:

    
    
     <?php
     $repo_dir = drush_get_option('root') ? drush_get_option('root') : getcwd();
     $success = drush_shell_exec('cd %s && git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2> ' . drush_bit_bucket(), $repo_dir);
     if ($success) {
        $output = drush_shell_exec_output();
        $repo = $output[0];
        $options['config'] = $repo . '/drush/drushrc.php';
        $options['include'] = $repo . '/drush/commands';
        $options['alias-path'] = $repo . '/drush/aliases';
     }

###  Setup Apache VH

Checkout locally the VeSafe from repository, and create a VirtualHost **in**
Apache to point to the $PROJECT/docroot/ directory, for example:

    
    
    ```
    <VirtualHost *:8080>
        ServerName vesafe.local.ro
        DocumentRoot /Users/cristiroma/Work/osha/vesafe/docroot/
        <Directory /Users/cristiroma/Work/osha/vesafe/docroot/>
            AllowOverride All
            Order allow,deny
            Allow from all
            # Required for httpd 2.4
            Require all granted
        </Directory>
    </VirtualHost>
    ```
    

Then restart apache to pick the new VH, then check <http://vesafe.local.ro>
works. At this stage Drupal should ask to make a new installation. **DON'T!
MOVE ON!**

Notes:

  * You need to add the domain (i.e. `vesafe.local.ro`) to your local `hosts` file (`/etc/hosts` or `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`) like this

`127.0.0.1 vesafe.local.ro`

  * You can checkout your project locally using git:

    
    
    git clone git@github.com:EU-OSHA/VeSafe.git
    git checkout develop
    

Later, please work on your own branch! Branching and development is described
in detail here: <https://github.com/EU-OSHA/osha-website/wiki>

###  Project setup

  * Copy `conf/config.template.json` to `conf/config.json` and customize to suit your environment, for example:
    
        {
        "db" : {
            "host": "localhost",
            "username" : "root",
            "password" : "root",
            "port": 3306,
            "database" : "osha_vesafe"
        },
        "admin" : {
            "username": "vesafe_admin",
            "password": "password",
            "email": "account@example.com"
        },
        "uri": "http://vesafe.local.ro",
        "solr_server": {
            "name": "Apache Solr server",
            "enabled": 1,
            "description": "",
            "scheme": "http",
            "host": "localhost",
            "port": 8080,
            "path": "/solr",
            "http_user": "",
            "http_password": "",
            "excerpt": 1,
            "retrieve_data": 1,
            "highlight_data": 1,
            "skip_schema_check": null,
            "solr_version": "",
            "http_method": "AUTO",
            "apachesolr_read_only": null,
            "apachesolr_direct_commit": 1,
            "apachesolr_soft_commit": 1
        },
        "variables": {
            "site_mail": "your.email@domain.org",
            "site_name": "VeSafe",
            "osha_data_dir": "/home/osha/data",
            "file_temporary_path": "/tmp"
        }
    }

  * Create file `drush/aliases/aliases.local.php` and define your drush staging alias, like this:

Note: replace `yourname` below with your username, i.e. `cristiroma`, `john`
whatever.

    
        $aliases['staging'] = array(
      'uri' => 'http://vesafe.edw.ro',
      'db-allows-remote' => TRUE,
      'remote-host' => '5.9.54.24',
      'remote-user' => 'php',
      'root' => '/var/www/html/osha-vesafe/docroot',
      'path-aliases' => array(
        '%files' => 'sites/default/files',
      ),
      'command-specific' => array(
        'sql-sync' => array(
          'simulate' => '1',
          'source-dump' => '/tmp/osha-vesafe-dump-yourname.sql',
        ),
      ),
    );

Note: After this if you go in the `docroot` and run `drush` in console you
should see something like this:

    
        cristiroma ~/Work/osha/vesafe/docroot $ drush sa
    @none
    @osha
    @osha.staging
    @self
    default
    

If you run `drush @osha.staging st` you connect to staging instance
(vesafe.edw.ro) via SSH and check it's status:

    
        cristiroma ~/Work/osha/vesafe/docroot $ drush @osha.staging st
     Drupal version                  :  7.X

     Install profile                 :  vesafe_profile
     Drupal root                     :  /var/www/html/osha-vesafe/docroot
     Drupal Settings File            :  sites/default/settings.php
     Site path                       :  sites/default
     File directory path             :  sites/default/files
     Temporary file directory path   :  /tmp
    

  * Create `docroot/sites/default/settings.local.php` file, example:

Note: Later you can add more settings here, custom to your installation, like
`memcached`, `varnish` etc.

    
        <?php
    $databases = array (
      'default' =>
        array (
          'default' =>
            array (
              'database' => 'osha_vesafe',
              'username' => 'root',
              'password' => 'root',
              'host' => 'localhost',
              'port' => '',
              'driver' => 'mysql',
              'prefix' => '',
            ),
        ),
    );

  * Run `install_from_staging.sh`

_Warning_ : Running `install_from_staging.sh` on an existing instance _will
destroy_ that instance (database) loosing all db changes (i.e. panels, blocks
etc.)!

The console output should look like this:

    
    
    cristiroma ~/Work/osha/vesafe $ ./install_from_staging.sh 
    Command variable-get needs a higher bootstrap level to run - you will need to invoke drush from a more functional Drupal environment to run this command.              [error]

**Note:** If the script fails, you can look into the script and try to execute
commands one-by-one using `drush -v -d` to debug.

###  Solr installation

You need Solr for search function and possible some other pages implemented
around Solr. Here's how you setup your Solr server:

  * Have installed the JDK 1.7 or 1.8.
  * Use the Solr from a specific prepared environment available at `https://github.com/EU-OSHA/drupal-solr` and checkout the 4.10 release
  * Create a new core, called 'vesafe' and start the Jetty container.

Here's a sample of the required commands:

    
    
      git clone https://github.com/EU-OSHA/drupal-solr ~/Work/drupal-solr
      cd ~/Work/drupal-solr/cores
      cp -r core0 vesafe
      echo name=vesafe > ./vesafe/core.properties
      cd ../
      ./start
    

##Repository Layout## Breakdown for what each directory/file is used for. See
also readme inside directories.

  * [conf](https://github.com/EU-OSHA/osha-website/tree/master/conf)
  * Project specific configuration files
  * [docroot](https://github.com/EU-OSHA/osha-website/tree/master/docroot)
  * Drupal root directory
  * [drush](https://github.com/EU-OSHA/osha-website/tree/master/drush)
  * Contains project specific drush commands, aliases, and configurations.
  * [results](https://github.com/EU-OSHA/osha-website/tree/master/results)
  * This directory is just used to export test results to. A good example of this is when running drush test-run with the --xml option. You can export the xml to this directory for parsing by external tools.
  * [scripts](https://github.com/EU-OSHA/osha-website/tree/master/scripts)
  * A directory for project-specific scripts.
  * [test](https://github.com/EU-OSHA/osha-website/tree/master/tests)
  * A directory for external tests. This is great for non drupal specific tests such as selenium, qunit, casperjs.
  * [.gitignore](https://github.com/EU-OSHA/osha-website/blob/master/.gitignore)
  * Contains the a list of the most common excluded files.
