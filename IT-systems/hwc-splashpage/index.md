    * Test: http://eu-osha.github.io/hwc-splashpage
    * Production: https://www.healthy-workplaces.eu
    

##  Pre-requisites

Install NPM & Grunt to call the build tasks.

    
    
    npm install -g grunt grunt-cli # global package to run grunt
    

##  Build

    
    
    git checkout master
    npm install
    
    Do development & commit
    
    git checkout gh-pages
    git merge master
    grunt dist
    git commit CSS & resources
    

##  To create a new release

  1. Bring all the changes to the `gh-pages` branch (i.e. `git checkout gh-pages && git merge master`)
  2. Build the distribution `grunt pack`, which will result in a new build artifact called `release.zip`. This is the release to be deployed in production.

This will create release.zip that is deployable in root directory of the web
server.

  3. Visit the _Release_ tab and draft a new release, add comments, and upload the `release.zip` (first rename to next increment i.e `release-1.2.4.zip`)

Info: The `grunt pack` compiles the LESS files into CSS, minifies the JS.

##  Deployment guidelines

    
    
    * Visit the release page and download the ZIP file attached to the latest release (ie. hwc-splashpage-v.1.0.0.zip)
    * Unzip the file in the root directory of your web server's virtual host
