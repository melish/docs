<small class="github">[oira.reports](https://github.com/EU-OSHA/oira.reports)</small>

This is a collection of [BIRT](http://www.eclipse.org/birt/) reports showing
statistical data for osha.oira.

##  Setup

Most of the setup is done by
[oira.batou](https://bitbucket.org/oshahosting/oira.batou/). You can add *.sql
files to the root of this repository with initializing queries that should be
run on deployment.
